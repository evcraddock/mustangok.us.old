Keep in mind for this weekend to plan for next weekend..  Boys that want to walk in the parade, bring 2 large bags of candy to hand out.  any moms and/or dad wanting to walk or ride (in golf cart-someone needs to bring one lol) we also need to have at least 2 large coolers of water for the walk.  Coach said the boys will have their jersey's on friday for game monday so they will wear those and we should meet at 9 if parade starts at 10.  

contact me if you want to walk with me and the boys.
