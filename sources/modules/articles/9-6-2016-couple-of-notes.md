A couple of things!! 

1)      No Touchdown club meeting tonight.

2)      Don’t forget the parade on Saturday (Details below)

3)      If you would like to help more and not sure what to do, please send a reply back to Louis and myself and we will find you some options to help. We really do have a special group of boys and parents. Ask any of the other age groups and you will see. Let’s keep it that way and make this an incredible experience for our boys!!
