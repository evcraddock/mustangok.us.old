Parents,

 

The Touchdown Club will not be feeding the boys this coming Monday.  It is a holiday and thus no school.  They need to be fed before they arrive to pre-game.

Coach Ketch wants the boys there about 3:45 for the 5PM game against Yukon.

 

TDC will provide Gatorade and a protein bar afterwards.

 

Go Broncos!!

Louis
