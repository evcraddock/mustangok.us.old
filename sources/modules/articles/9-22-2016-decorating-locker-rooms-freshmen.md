At the Touchdown club meeting last Tuesday night we talked about decorating the Freshman lockers for homecoming.
Debbie bunch is meeting up at their locker room noon tomorrow morning.  She will need help.
We will need parents to donate the supplies!
Red, white and black streamers, balloons, poster boards and markers!
