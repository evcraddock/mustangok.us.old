A quick reminder that there is a game on Monday. It will be a home game and we will feed them before the game and get them Gatorade after the game. There was some confusion but the game is most definitely at home. If you can help at 3pm with the feeding, please let me know and we will kick off this season right!! We will feed them in the Weight room which is located in the north part of the field house.
