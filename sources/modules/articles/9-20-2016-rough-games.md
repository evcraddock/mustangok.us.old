I really want to make sure we can keep things into perspective. We have had a couple tough losses in a row but we need to be mindful of our roles as parents. We are here to support and encourage. No matter how frustrated we get, we need to show our boys how to act in tough situations. Please Please Please try to cheer them on loudly and avoid any negative voicing of opinions that could offend our players, coaches, or other parents.

 

This is not a place blame email but instead a call to action to really focus on what is important and help our boys have the best season possible.

 

For what it is worth ;)
